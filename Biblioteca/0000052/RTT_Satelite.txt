Performance of Satellite Gateway over Geostationary Satellite Links



A significant amount of today's Internet traffic, including World Wide Web (WWW), 
file transfer, e-mail and remote access traffic, is carried by the Transmission C
ontrol Protocol (TCP) transport protocol. Geostationary satellite links have a 
number of features that may degrade the performance of the TCP over them. 
The satellite links have an average round-trip time (RTT) of around 500 ms. 
The TCP uses a slow-start phase to probe the network at the start of a connection. 
The time spent in the slow-start phase is directly proportional to the RTT. 
For a satellite link, it means that the TCP stays in the slow-start phase for a l
onger time than in the case of a small RTT link. This drastically decreases the 
throughput of the short-duration TCP connection. Furthermore, when packets are lost, t
he TCP enters the congestion-avoidance phase. Due to the higher RTT, the TCP remains 
in the congestion-avoidance phase for a longer time, which reduces the throughput of 
both short and long-duration TCP connections. Satellite gateways are proven to improve
 the TCP throughput by 300 -- 800% across high-delay and lossy satellite links.
