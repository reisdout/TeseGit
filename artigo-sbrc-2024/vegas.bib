	abstract = {Vegas is a new implementation of TCP that achieves between 40 and 70\% better throughput, with one-fifth to onehalf the losses, as compared to the implementation of TCP in the Reno distribution of B SD Unix. This paper motivates and describes the three key techniques employed by Vegas, and presents the results of a comprehensive experimental performance study—using both simulations and measurements on the Internet—of the Vegas and Reno implementations of TCP.},
